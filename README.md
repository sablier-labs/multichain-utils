# Multichain Deployer

A Rust-based utility script for deploying Sablier contracts on multiple chains via a single CLI, meant to be used by the Sablier team.

## About

This script offers a CLI tool designed to enhance the experience of deploying Solidity smart contracts across multiple chains. It streamlines the deployment of Sablier contracts by automating the `forge script` command with the appropriate flags for targeting specific chains.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. See the installation guide [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
- Foundry toolchain installed on your machine. See the installation guide [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html).

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sablier-labs/multichain-deployer.git
cd multichain-deployer
cargo install --path . # Install the CLI locally
```

## Usage

```bash
multichain-deployer <chain_name> [OPTIONS]
```

### Flags:

- `--all` - deploy on all chains declared in the `foundry.toml` file
- `--broadcast` - wether the deployment should be broadcasted or not
- `--cp-bf` - copy the broadcasts generated by foundry from to the `deployments` directory
- `--gas-price` - the gas price to use for the deployment in wei
- `--help` Prints a help message
- `--log` - Creates a Markdown file with the deployed contracts at `deployments.md`
- `--script` - the script to run for deployment
- `--verify` - Verify deployment on the respective chain explorer

### Example:

```bash
multichain-deployer sepolia --script DeployFlow.s.sol
```

**Output:**

```bash
Deploying to the chains: sepolia
Running the deployment command: FOUNDRY_PROFILE=optimized forge script script/DeployFlow.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia
```

## Assumptions:

- The script is run within a Foundry project, with a `script` directory declared at the root of the project.
- Chain names match the ones declared in the `foundry.toml` [file](https://github.com/sablier-labs/flow/blob/1090a29c0270daf46c6023cab5d4df76504abe34/foundry.toml#L79-L102)
- If the `--cp-bf` flag is used, the deployments directory is expected to exist at `../deployments`
- If the `--verify` flag is used, Etherscan API keys must be set in the `.env` file in the format: `<chain_name_from_foundry_toml>_API_KEY`.
  - e.g. 1. mainnet --> `MAINNET_API_KEY` 2. avalanche --> `AVALANCHE_API_KEY`
